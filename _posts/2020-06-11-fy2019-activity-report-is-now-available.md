To make it easier to read, the activity report is also available for viewing in our main product, Vivliostyle Viewer. Check out the results of CSS typesetting.

As we wrote in the activity report, FY2019 was a period of preparation for the leap forward. Let's jump farther in FY2020, we're going for it!
