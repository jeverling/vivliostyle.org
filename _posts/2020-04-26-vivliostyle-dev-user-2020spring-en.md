(The original article is [「Vivliostyle ユーザーと開発者の集い 2020春」開催報告](https://vivliostyle.org/ja/blog/2020/04/26/vivliostyle-dev-user-2020spring/) in Japanes)

Sorry for the delay, but we were able to finish the "Vivliostyle User/Dev meetup Spring 2020" without any problems.

In our previous post on March 21, we reported that in response to the pandemic from the fold, in addition to gathering participants at the venue, we would also be distributing videos online. In April, however, the situation continued to deteriorate and we were forced to change the venue to online only.

Despite such a bad environment, I think we managed to present "The Present and Future of Vivliostyle" with a lot of presentations by 8 speakers.

In particular, I would like to thank the two guest speakers, [kondoyuko] (https://twitter.com/kondoyuko) and [カウプラン機関極東支部] (https://twitter.com/_kauplan), who accepted to speak in the midst of this adversity. It was a valuable opportunity for Vivliostyle in the future to have the opportunity to hear frank opinions from the outside world.

It was also good to be able to report on the "Vivliostyle Pub," which is under development for release later this year, from a variety of angles, including backend, frontend, and markdown.

I would have liked to have been able to exchange opinions with the guests and visitors at the reception, but I was not able to do so. I hope to have the opportunity to do so at a later date.

All slides and video recordings of the day have been compiled on the recruitment page below. Please take a look when you have the time.
