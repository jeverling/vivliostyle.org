(The original article is [「Vivliostyle ユーザーと開発者の集い 2020春」開催報告](https://vivliostyle.org/ja/blog/2020/04/26/vivliostyle-dev-user-2020spring/) in Japanese)

Sorry for the late report, but we successfully held the "Vivliostyle User/Dev meetup Spring 2020".

In [our previous post on March 21](https://vivliostyle.org/blog/2020/03/21/We-will-hold-Vivliostyle-User-and-Developer-Gathering-Spring-2020/), we planned that we would be distributing videos online in addition to gathering participants at the venue. However, as the pandemic situation worsened in April, we had to change it to an online only event.

Despite such a bad environment, I think we managed to present "The Present and Future of Vivliostyle" with a lot of presentations by 8 speakers.

In particular, I would like to thank the two guest speakers, [kondoyuko](https://twitter.com/kondoyuko) and [カウプラン機関極東支部](https://twitter.com/_kauplan), who accepted to speak in the midst of this adversity. It was a valuable opportunity for Vivliostyle in the future to have the opportunity to hear frank opinions from the outside world.

It was also good to be able to report on the "Vivliostyle Pub," which is under development for release later this year, from a variety of angles, including backend, frontend, and markdown.

I would have liked to have been able to exchange opinions with the guests and visitors at the reception, but I was not able to do so. I hope to have the opportunity to do so at a later date.

All slides and video recordings of the day have been compiled on the event page below. Please take a look when you have the time.
