The FY2020 Activity Report has been released as follows.

- [FY2020 Activity Report](https://vivliostyle.org/about-us/#fy2020-activity-report)

So many things happened last fiscal year. There was the sudden pandemic, in which the contributors proposed to apply for the Mitou Advanced Project to secure development funds. The team worked together to develop the Vivliostyle Pub alpha version. Nevertheless, They were not selected. After overcoming the shock, Vivliostyle CLI, Vivliostyle Themes, VFM, and Vivliostyle Viewer have been greatly enhanced. All thanks to our contributors.

The financial report is also included in Chapter 2. Although we are still in the red, we were able to generate about 1.5 million yen in ordinary income last year. Of that amount, about 60,000 yen came from [donations from the general public.](https://vivliostyle.org/sponsors/) We would like to increase the number of such activities in this fiscal year. This report is a 13-page A4 document that summarizes the events of the past year. In the link above, you can view the report in an easy-to-read format using the Vivliostyle Viewer. Please take a look!
