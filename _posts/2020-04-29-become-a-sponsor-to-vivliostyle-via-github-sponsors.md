We got approved for the GitHub Sponsors program that we had applied for, and the call for sponsors page is now open:

- [Become a sponsor to Vivliostyle](https://github.com/sponsors/vivliostyle)

From this page, you can support a certain amount of money per month to Vivliostyle by clicking the "Select" button on any tier. You can choose between two types of payment: credit card or PayPal.

You can also make anonymous donations by selecting "Private" in the "Who can see your sponsorship?" section (the default is "Everyone").
