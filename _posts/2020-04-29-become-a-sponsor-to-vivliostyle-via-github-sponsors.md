The original article is [GitHub Sponsors で Vivliostyle を支援しませんか](https://vivliostyle.org/ja/blog/2020/04/29/become-a-sponsor-to-vivliostyle-via-github-sponsors/) in Japanese)

We had previously applied for GitHub Sponsors, and the other day we passed the screening and the recruitment page was released.

- [Become a sponsor to vivliostyle](https://github.com/sponsors/vivliostyle)

From this page, you can support a certain amount of money per month to Vivliostyle by clicking the "Select" button on any tier. You can choose between two types of payment: credit card or PayPal.

In addition, who can see your sponsorship? If you select "Private", you can also make anonymous donations (the default is "Everyone" to open your name).

There are 10 tiers in total, ranging from $1 to $6,000 per month, with a wide range of options available. The recruitment page is in English, so i'll explain it here by the Japanese translation.
